# ELEC3607_Project
This project aims to achieve a **TERIS game**. 
It is played by controlling a triple axes accelerometer connected to the **ArduinoDUE Board**.<br/>
This game can be displayed on the PC screen via a USB cable connected to **ArduinoDUE board**. <br/>
Then Game results will be stored locally, and are later sent to playersâ€™ phone via a **BlueTooth module**. <br/>
