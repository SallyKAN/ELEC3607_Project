# ELEC3607_Project
This project aims to achieve a TERIS game. It is played by controlling a triple axes accelerometer which is connected to the ArduinoDUE board, and this game can be display on the PC screen via a USB cable connected to ArduinoDUE board. Then Game results will be stored locally, and are later reported via Bluetooth to usersâ€™ phone.
